# End Slide Cutter AI

****PLEASE NOTE: This project is still in progress, files are in the process of being uploaded as we speak. Please check other available projects on this [link.](https://github.com/HarryLMoss) Thank you for your patience.***

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of detecting and extracting end slides from video content. It utilizes TensorFlow and OpenCV for processing video frames and employs a pretrained VGG16 model for enhanced feature extraction. The goal is to accurately identify the transition to end slides in videos, enabling automated content editing and analysis.

## Features
- **Video Frame Extraction**: Processes videos to extract relevant frames for analysis, targeting specific time windows to optimise performance.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Leverages the VGG16 model for accurate end slide detection, trained on a custom dataset of video frames.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Includes a system to avoid reprocessing videos, enhancing the usability of the system for iterative testing and development.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/end-slide-detection.git
cd end-slide-detection
```
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, and then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To start processing videos and detecting end slides, run:

```bash
python modelRunning.py
```
Ensure your video files are placed in the designated testVideos directory as specified in the script parameters.

## Project Structure
modelRunning.py: The main script for processing videos, extracting frames, and running the detection model.
requirements.txt: Lists all the project dependencies for easy installation via pip.
best_model.h5: The pretrained TensorFlow model optimized for detecting end slides.
